## üöÄ Installation & Setup
This application can be run directly from the Python script or compiled into a standalone Windows executable (.exe) using PyInstaller.

Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

Install Dependencies: Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries:

```pip install tkinter numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance sv-ttk pillow pytz```

Running from Source
Save the Files: Save the main script as Share_monitor.py (or whatever your current name is).

Run the Application: Execute the script from your terminal:

```python Share_monitor.py```

## üì¶ Building the Standalone Executable (.EXE)
To create a single, portable executable file (which includes the necessary assets like the logo), you need to use PyInstaller.

1. Requirements
Make sure you have PyInstaller installed:
pip install pyinstaller

2. Prepare Assets
Ensure you have your logo file (logo.png) and the Windows icon file (logo.ico) in the same directory as your main script.

3. PyInstaller Command
Run the following command in your terminal from the script's directory. This command packages the application, creates a single executable, sets the application icon, and bundles the logo image for the splash screen:

```pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "ASX_Share_Monitor" --icon="logo.ico" --add-data "logo.png:." "Share_monitor.py"```

5. Run the EXE
The compiled executable (ASX_Share_Monitor.exe) will be found in the newly created dist folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage NotesAdding Stocks:

Enter the ASX ticker symbol (e.g., BHP) and click Add ASX Stock or simply press the Enter key while the input field is focused. The .AX extension is added automatically if missing.
Chart Visibility: On the Main Monitor tab, use the CHART ($\checkmark$/$\times$) column to click and toggle individual lines on or off the combined plot. This is useful for dealing with shares of vastly different values (e.g., a $100 stock and a $1 stock).
Settings: Access Settings to permanently set the default Timezone and Chart Range.
Tooltip: Hover your mouse over any line on the chart to display the historical price and time at that point, along with the latest daily and hourly change data.
